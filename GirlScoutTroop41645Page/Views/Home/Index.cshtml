                        Girl Scout membership Registration fee is $65 for the 25/26 Scouting Year.  Our troop Dues/activity fee is $40 a year.
                        Scouts that participate in the Annual Girl Scout Cookie sales can often cover their dues through Money Raising efforts.
                        Financial Assistance is available for those that qualify through Girl Scouts of Western Washington.  
                        The annual dues help the troop offset day to day operations as well as craft and activity costs along with 
                        providing your child with badges, and awards. If we decide to do anything above and beyond, we will discuss 
                        additional fees at that time. We will review the dues/activity fee at times to ensure that costs are being 
                        covered by the troop, but we will do what we can to keep your costs as low as possible.

                            If you would like to be active in our Girl Scout meetings, 
                            then you must be a registered through Girl Scouts of Western Washington.  
                            There is a membership fee for Adults to register, however if your scout qualifies for Financial Assistance, 
                            your membership is covered as well.  There are 2 forms to fill out…one for the background check and the other 
                            is the Adult Registration form similar to the Girl Scout Registration form. We ask for at least one adult per 
                            family to be registered.

            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                Our troop meets weekly in Montesano, Washington - our scouts come from all over 
                Grays Harbor including: McCleary, Elma, Montesano, Central Park, Aberdeen, 
                Cosmopolis and Hoquiam.  Our regular meeting time is at 6pm on Wednesday evenings, 
                in the lower level of Montesano Church of God on Spruce Street.  The troop meets 
                September through early June, taking a break from regular activities during the 
                summer and school breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Girl Scout Troop spans from Daisies (Kindergarten) through Ambassadors (High School Seniors) 
                and everything in between.  Each level meets separately, but we have special meeting nights 
                and activities throughout the year for the full troop.  Our special troop dynamic fosters a 
                family atmosphere with scouts forming bonds with other scouts in different levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Girl Scouts we aim to make the world a better place, and be a sister to every Girl Scout.
