# GirlScoutTroop41645Page
This is my first project with an actual client. My daughter's Girl Scout (GS) Troop Leader asked me to create a website for the troop to assist with disseminating information.

## Description
This is a one-stop landing page for everything that Troop 41645 needs, including calendar management, picture repository, membership dues processing, form submissions, and overall community involvement. The goal is to create a standard for GS family communication and engagement.

## WEBSITE IS LIVE
